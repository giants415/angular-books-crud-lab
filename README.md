#Angular Books Training

##Class Repo: https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/angular-books-crud-lab

###Reflection: This training was difficult for me as I had trouble checking my work in progress. I started out with ng-view and therefore had to build my entire controller and route before I could have something show up. In general though, this project helped me with understanding Angular better and I have another reference to build future angular apps.
